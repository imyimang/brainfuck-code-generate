A python repo that can convert input text into Brainfuck code

## English | [繁體中文](readme.md) 

# How to use
run `main.py`
# How to run the brainfuck code
**Way1**
 - Using the [brainfuckHelper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ComputerElite.brainfuckhelper) extension for VS Code.

 - After pressing F1 in main.bf, select 'Execute Brainfuck' to run.

**Way2**
 - Using an online Brainfuck compiler.

 - Open the [online Brainfuck compiler](https://ashupk.github.io/Brainfuck/brainfuck-visualizer-master/index.html#)

 - Enter the content of main.bf and then press Run.

# Please note
This program simply converts text into ASCII and then into Brainfuck code; it does not have input functionality.

The online compiler has a memory cell limit of 27. This project clears the cell after outputting the text, so it only occupies one cell throughout. However, future modifications to the project should take this into account.
